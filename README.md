# MRI Brain Tumor Classification

## Project Description

This project compares the performance of a deep learning model (CNN Classifier) with three traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, and SVM) for binary image classification. The task involves detecting the presence or absence of a tumor in MRI brain scan images.

## Models Compared

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Key Findings

The CNN model showed superior performance over traditional models, highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning for image classification tasks.
